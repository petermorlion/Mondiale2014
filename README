Disclaimer: this was hacked together very quickly to meet a deadline (the start of the World Cup 2014). 
It is not an example of the code I normally would write :)

It is my first Angular app, and is/was actively used by a group of friends to see who could best predict the scores of the World Cup.

## Database

Just a reminder, so I don't have to Google it everytime (examples).

Add a migration and update the database locally:

```
Add-Migration v3.7.0
Update-Database
```

Update on Azure:

```
Update-Database -ConnectionString "..." -ConnectionProviderName "System.Data.SqlClient"
```
